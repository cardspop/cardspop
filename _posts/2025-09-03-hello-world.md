This is your first post. Replace the placeholders below with your content.

## Video (YouTube embed)

<div class="video">
  <iframe
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID"
    title="YouTube video"
    frameborder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
    allowfullscreen
  ></iframe>
  <p class="caption">Replace VIDEO_ID with your video.</p>
  
</div>

## Big download (GitHub Release)

- Releases page: https://github.com/cardspop/cardspop/releases
- Direct download example (replace filename):
- [Download slides (PDF)](https://github.com/cardspop/cardspop/releases/latest/download/slides.pdf)

Tip: Upload assets to a Release. The `latest/download/filename` URL always points to the most recent release asset with that name.
