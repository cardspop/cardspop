This is your first post. Replace the placeholders below with your content.

## Video (YouTube embed)

<div class="video">
  <iframe
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID"
    title="YouTube video"
    frameborder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
    allowfullscreen
  ></iframe>
  <p class="caption">Replace VIDEO_ID with your video.</p>
  
</div>

## Big download (GitHub Release)

- Example release download link:
- [Download slides (PDF)](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo/releases/download/v1.0/slides.pdf)

Tip: Use GitHub Releases for large, versioned files. It keeps the repo light and provides a CDN-backed URL.
