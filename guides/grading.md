title: How to Grade Cards

Goal: decide “grade or not” and set realistic grade targets before paying submission fees.

What you need
- Light: bright, diffuse light at 45°; avoid harsh direct beams.
- Magnification: 10× loupe or phone macro clip.
- Microfiber + soft blower: remove dust; never rub debris.
- Sleeves/toploaders or card saver 1 for storage.

Quick pre‑grade checklist (raw card)
- Centering: eyeball first, then measure. Front/back both matter. Target ≤60/40 for PSA 10 candidates.
- Corners: check all 4 front/back. Look for dings, whitening, soft tips.
- Edges: scan long edges for chipping, fray, factory cuts, foil lift.
- Surface: tilt under light; look for print lines, dimples, roller marks, scratches.
- Print: registration (double images), color dots, missing foil.
- Back: staining, rough edges, print defects.

Centering quick math (visual)
- Horizontal: left border (L), image width (I), right border (R). Centering ≈ min(L,R)/(L+I+R).
- Use a clear ruler or overlay lines on a photo to compare border widths.

Grade expectations (rule of thumb)
- PSA 10: near‑perfect centering (≈55/45 or better), no print lines, no corner/edge issues.
- PSA 9: tiny flaw allowed (minor print line, slight edge tick, 60/40 centering).
- PSA 8: a few minor flaws or worse centering; still clean overall.

When to submit
- Card value graded ≥ fee × 3–5 and demand is strong.
- Key rookies, low‑numbered parallels, on‑card autos, vintage stars.
- Avoid over‑submitting base unless comps justify it.

Prep for submission
- Clean: only loose dust with air + microfiber light dabs (no chemicals).
- Sleeve carefully: penny sleeve, then Card Saver 1 (PSA) or toploader + team bag.
- Document: take front/back photos; note defect(s) and target grade.

SGC/BGS/PSA quick notes
- PSA: liquidity/price leader for modern; favors eye appeal and centering.
- SGC: fast, strong for vintage; clean black tux slab.
- BGS (or BGS Vintage/Beckett): subgrades helpful; turnaround varies.

Pass/Fail decision
- If any corner is clearly damaged, or print line through face/logos, or centering worse than ~65/35, likely not a 9/10 → do not submit unless card is rare/PC.

Storage if not grading
- Clean sleeve + toploader/mag, team bag; store upright; low humidity.
